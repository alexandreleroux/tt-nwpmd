The repository details the structure of [WIS2 topic hierarchy](https://github.com/wmo-im/wis2-topic-hierarchy) of NWP data, which are one branch of domain-specific topic subcategories beyond level 9.

* The topic hierarchy is organized as nested directory structure, following the values [weather](weather/) on Level 8 and `prediction` on Level 9. First two levels of directory (i.e. /weather/prediction/) is to indicate the branching from the main WIS2 topic hierarchy.
* The subsequent directory structure is the value of each level.
